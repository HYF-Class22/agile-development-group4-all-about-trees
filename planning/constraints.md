# Constraints

In order to manage our project effectively, it's important to define and
acknowledge various constraints that impact our work.

## External

Constraints coming from external sources that our team has no control over.
These may include:

- **Project Deadlines:** The project must be completed by [specific deadline].
- **UI Design or Color Schemes:** Adherence to predefined UI design elements or
  color schemes.
- **Technologies:** Requirements to use specific technologies mandated by
  stakeholders or clients.

## Internal: Involuntary

Constraints originating from within our team, over which we have limited
control. These may include:

- **Individual Skill Levels:** Varied skill levels among team members impacting
  task assignments and project outcomes.
- **Time Availability:** Limited availability of team members due to other
  commitments or obligations.

## Internal: Voluntary

Constraints that our team has voluntarily agreed upon to help scope the project
effectively. These may include:

- **Coding Style & Conventions:** Adherence to specific coding style guidelines
  and conventions agreed upon by the team.
- **Code Review Checklist:** A predefined checklist for code reviews to ensure
  code quality and consistency.
- **Project Time Allocation:** Setting specific hours or timeframes for project
  work to manage workload and prevent burnout.
- **Color Palette:** Limiting the color palette to black and white for a
  minimalist design approach.

By recognizing and understanding these constraints, we can better navigate
challenges and make informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
