## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

Our website design and features turned out almost exactly as we planned

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

We added mixed (must-have, should-have, could-have) features in same push due to
time limitations.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
